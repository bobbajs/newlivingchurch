In 2012, the church became independent from the Vancouver body and began an affiliation with The Jesus Network in Toronto. Through prayer, the church discerned a vision to broaden their outreach beyond Indonesian speakers. House for All Nations Toronto changed its name to New Living Church and began English services in 2016."
